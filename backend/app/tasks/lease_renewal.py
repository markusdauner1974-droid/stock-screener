"""Heartbeat renewal for short-lived Redis workload leases.

Leases are taken with a short TTL (``settings.data_fetch_lock_timeout``) and
renewed by a daemon thread for as long as the holder runs. If the worker
process dies (OOM kill, container restart) the thread dies with it and the
lease expires within one TTL instead of blocking the market for hours.
