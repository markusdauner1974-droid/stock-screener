    Single definition on purpose. ``for_feature_run`` (counted) and

    different shapes, and before this they decided the survivor flag with
    different SQL: the grouped path used ``as_boolean().is_(True)``, the counted
    path a text comparison. Identical data then classified differently depending
    on which path read it -- on PostgreSQL the cast also accepts ``'t'``,
    ``'yes'`` and ``'on'``, which the text comparison rejected, and it raises on
    a value like ``'2'`` while the text comparison does not.

    Cast-free by requirement: this expression is also the one migration
    ``20260926_0058`` indexes, and ``CREATE INDEX`` evaluates it against every
    row of every historical run. A cast that can raise would fail the startup
    migration on a single bad value.

    ``IN`` matching ``lower(...)`` needs both members because the two backends
    spell JSON ``true`` differently: PostgreSQL keeps the boolean and ``->>``
    renders the text ``'true'``; SQLite stores it as the integer ``1``, so its
    ``->>`` yields ``'1'``. ``'1'`` never occurs in the Postgres text form, so
    the extra member is inert there.

    Values outside the list -- ``'t'``, ``'yes'``, ``'on'``, ``'2'`` -- are not

    feature-run path and the drift guard) rather than only as SQL text, so a
    change here is what the migration is compared against -- one definition, two
    consumers, no second copy to forget.

    Both keys go through ``portability.json_text``, which inlines them as SQL
    literals. ``details["action_state"].as_string()`` would render
    ``->> %(details_json_1)s`` instead: psycopg2 interpolates that client-side,
    but a generic plan (and every server-side-binding driver) sees a parameter,
    cannot match it to the index's literal, and silently drops the index -- which
    on this table means a 154 s full scan instead of milliseconds.

    The survivor test is a cast-free ``lower(...) IN ('true', '1')`` rather than
    ``CAST(... AS BOOLEAN) IS true``. A boolean cast raises
    ``invalid input syntax for type boolean`` on non-boolean text, and inside the
    index that fails the startup migration (one bad value anywhere in the table)
    and every later insert/update carrying such a value. The ``IN`` list cannot

    Both list members are needed for the two backends to agree. PostgreSQL stores
    a JSON ``true`` and ``->>`` hands it back as the text ``'true'``; SQLite
    stores the same value as the integer ``1``, so its ``->>`` yields ``'1'``.
    Matching only ``'true'`` silently counts every survivor as a non-survivor on
    SQLite, where the grouped pivot used to read it as truthy -- so the survivor
    counts would differ by backend for identical data. ``'1'`` never occurs in
    the Postgres text form, so the extra member is inert there.

        The grouped pass (``_aggregate``) reads ``action_state`` and

        ``details_json`` to do it -- 10,079 rows at ~64 kB measured 19,357 ms on
        the production table. Neither ``Index Scan`` nor ``Bitmap Heap Scan`` is
        an index-only scan, so an expression index on the two *grouped* keys does
        not remove that work: the planner picked such an index up and the time
        did not move (19,768 ms).

        Counting per state instead of grouping moves both keys into ``WHERE``,
        where ``ix_sfd_run_action_state_survivor`` (migration ``20260926_0058``)
        serves them as index conditions and the stored document is read far less.
        Measured against a copy of the production table, with the index and its
        ``ANALYZE``: 6,281 / 6,162 / 8,667 / 9,646 / 12,537 ms disk-bound, and
        12.292 ms buffer-warm. In the same session the grouped pass stayed at
        19,176-19,465 ms.

        ``rows_total`` and ``survivor_count`` are served as index-only scans; the
        per-state counts fall back to a ``Bitmap Heap Scan`` when the state
        matches thousands of rows, so they still visit the heap. That residual
        cost is why this rewrite and the migration only make sense together --
        the grouped shape reads every document rather than a subset. Without the
        index this shape costs 154,462 ms, since each of the sixteen counts scans
        the run on its own.

        The keys are extracted through ``json_text`` rather than
        ``details["key"].as_string()``. That is not a stylistic choice: the
        subscript form renders the key as a *bind parameter*
        (``->> %(details_json_1)s``), which a generic plan cannot match to the
        index's inline literal, so the index would silently go unused and this
        shape would fall back to the 154 s full-scan case. ``json_text`` exists
        for exactly this and inlines the key.

        The unknown-state contract is preserved: an unrecognised ``action_state``
        lands in no bucket, as it did when the pivot skipped it, while still
