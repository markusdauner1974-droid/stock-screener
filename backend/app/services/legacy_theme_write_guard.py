"""Keep unfenced legacy Theme writers out of economic authority (#472).

Fenced legacy writers go through ``legacy_producer_write``, which admits only
``LEGACY_WRITE_MODES``. The writers that bypass that fence use the same mode set
here, at two points:

- On entry: tasks skip, APIs return 409 and CLIs refuse, so nothing starts.
- On write: a guarded writer (a decorated task, or a session marked with
  ``mark_legacy_theme_writer``) takes the shared publication fence in the
  transaction of its first write and re-checks the mode there, holding the
  fence until commit, as ``producer_write`` does. A cutover therefore waits for
  in-flight legacy writes, and a write after the switch fails closed. Locking
  per transaction rather than for a whole task avoids a deadlock with nested
  fenced writes on other connections.
